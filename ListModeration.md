# List Moderation Guidance

Creation of an email list creates a moral obligation to ensure that it is not used for harmful purposes.
Every W3C list has one or more moderators.  By default, the moderators are the group's chairs, the list's maintainers or W3C administrators, 
but specific individuals may also be appointed as moderators.  The purpose of list moderation is to ensure that the list is used in keeping with W3C's mission and values.

## Moderator Guidelines

- Ensure that list participants abide by the [W3C Code of Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/) (CPC).
  - Flagrant violations of the CPC should be addressed on list and should identify the offending message -- even if there is also private follow-up -- in order to clearly convey W3C's commitment to the CPC. 
  - A pattern of repeated subtle violations of the CPC should be addressed on list without specifically calling out offending message, but should remind the readership of the CPC and general principle that was violated.  The tone of the message should assume that the offense was unintentional and should explain how the messages can be viewed as harmful.
  - Subtle or one-time minor violations of the CPC should be addressed with a private communication to the offender.  The private communication should assume that the offense was unintentional, should explain why it was offensive, and should point the offender to the CPC.
