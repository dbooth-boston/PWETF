# List Moderation Guidance

Every email list creates an obligation to ensure that it is not used for harmful purposes.
By default, a list's moderators are the group's chairs, the list's maintainers or W3C administrators, 
but specific individuals may also be appointed as moderators.  The purpose of list moderation is to ensure that the list is used in keeping with W3C's mission and values.

## Moderator Guidelines

W3C list moderation typically requires only a very light touch.

Main responsibilities:
- Follow all posted content, at least enough to notice whether any content violates W3C policies.
- Ensure that list participants abide by the [W3C Code of Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/) (CPC).  The enforcement approach should depend on the circumstances:
  - First-time minor violations of the CPC should be addressed with a private communication to the offender.  The private communication should assume that the offense was unintentional, should explain why it was offensive, and should point the offender to the CPC.
  - A pattern of repeated subtle violations of the CPC should be addressed on list without specifically calling out the offending message, but should remind the readership of the CPC and general principle that was violated.  The tone of the message should assume that the offense was unintentional and should explain how the messages can be viewed as harmful.
  - Flagrant violations of the CPC should be addressed on list and should identify the offending message -- even if there is also private follow-up -- in order to clearly convey W3C's commitment to the CPC.  Particularly egregious violations should be brought to a W3C Ombud.  Any violation involving a threat to life or property should be reported to police.
- Remove malware links and spam.

Rarely needed, but sometimes helpful:
- Help start productive conversations.
- Thank authors for particularly insightful posts.  This can be done privately (off list), but occasional on-list accolades are also helpful.
- Gently guide conversations in a more productive direction if they get too far off track.
